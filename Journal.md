Graphic updated with round objects (i.e. planets) and a rounder orbital pattern.

Collision detection has been added, so they bounce on impact.

#### 14:40

Graphic now shows multiple objects orbiting each other quite nicely.

The mass of each object can be changed.

The system appears to work with *n* bodies. This is nice!
